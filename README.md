# BuilderForce WebContainers

An open, forkable in-browser dev runtime. Hand it a project as files; it serves a
live preview in an iframe, with TypeScript, JSX, CSS, JSON and npm packages working
like they do under Vite, all running in the user's browser.

It is the runtime behind [BuilderForce.ai](https://builderforce.ai)'s canvas
previews, built to be forked.

| Package | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`@seanhogg/builderforce-webcontainers-core`](packages/core) | The dev server, runtime-agnostic and testable in Node: virtual file system, module resolution, import rewriting, CSS/JSON/asset modules, project detection |
| [`@seanhogg/builderforce-webcontainers`](packages/browser) | The browser runtime: boots the dev server in a page and serves it to an iframe through a service worker. Compiles with esbuild-wasm. |

## Why another one

| | BuilderForce WebContainers | StackBlitz WebContainers |
|---|---|---|
| Licence | MIT. Fork it, ship it, sell it. A small badge is on by default and can be switched off. | Proprietary. Free tier non-commercial, attribution required. |
| Session cap | None | 25,000 API sessions/month on the free tier |
| Cross-origin isolation (COOP/COEP) | **Not required**: embeds and third-party scripts keep working | Required |
| Compiler / package source | Pluggable ports: swap esbuild for SWC, esm.sh for your own mirror | Fixed |
| Errors | Uncaught errors in the preview are posted to the host page | — |
| Node.js servers, `npm install`, shell | Not yet (see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)) | Yes |

Today it runs **frontend apps**: Vite and Create React App projects, and static
sites. Frameworks that need a Node server or a component compiler are detected
and declined with a reason, so a host can fall back to another runtime instead of
showing a broken preview. The roadmap is how it closes the rest of the gap.

## Quick start

```ts
import { bootPreviewRuntime } from '@seanhogg/builderforce-webcontainers';

// 1. Serve node_modules/@seanhogg/builderforce-webcontainers/dist/sw.js at /__bfwc/sw.js
// 2. Boot, mount, preview:
const runtime = await bootPreviewRuntime({ serviceWorkerUrl: '/__bfwc/sw.js', id: 'my-project' });
runtime.mount({
  'package.json': JSON.stringify({ dependencies: { react: '^18.3.1', 'react-dom': '^18.3.1' } }),
  'index.html': '<div id="root"></div><script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>',
  'src/main.tsx': `import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(<h1>Hello</h1>);`,
});

if (runtime.profile().supported) iframe.src = runtime.url;
runtime.onError((e) => console.warn('preview crashed:', e.message));

// Edits show on the next load of the iframe; nothing to restart.
runtime.fs.writeFile('/src/main.tsx', '...');
```

Requirements: a secure context (https or localhost) for the service worker. That
is all.

## How it works

```
 host page                                    service worker (/__bfwc/sw.js)
 ┌──────────────────────────────┐            ┌─────────────────────────────┐
 │ VirtualFileSystem            │  MessagePort│ GET /__bfwc/<id>/src/App.tsx│
 │ DevServer ── esbuild-wasm    │◀───────────▶│  → forwarded to the page    │
 │   resolve · rewrite imports  │            │ everything else: untouched  │
 └──────────────────────────────┘            └─────────────────────────────┘
          ▲ iframe src = /__bfwc/<id>/              │ react, lodash … → esm.sh
```

* **No bundling.** Each file is compiled on request and served as a native ES
  module, the way Vite's dev server works, so startup is immediate and an edit
  recompiles one file.
* **Packages from a CDN.** Bare imports become esm.sh URLs, version-pinned from
  `package.json`, with shared dependencies deduped (one React).
* **Stateless worker.** Browsers kill idle service workers; when that happens the
  worker asks open pages to re-attach instead of failing the request.

## Attribution

Every preview shows a small **"Built with Builderforce.ai"** badge in its
bottom-right corner. It sits in a shadow root, so it never collides with the app's
styles, and it follows the system light/dark theme.

It is on by default and **not** a licence condition: the project is MIT, and you
can turn it off with `bootPreviewRuntime({ ..., attribution: false })`. If this
runtime saves you money, please leave it on. That link is how the project is
funded.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```
